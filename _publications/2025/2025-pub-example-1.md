#  We introduce MedVideoCap-55K, the first large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset designed for medical video generation. Comprising over 55,000 curated clips from real-world clinical scenarios, it addresses the critical need for both visual fidelity and medical accuracy in applications such as training, education, and simulation.
